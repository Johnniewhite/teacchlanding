WHY JOIN TED CIRCLE 
Learn from experiments
While experience is valuable, the real breakthroughs happen when we step outside of what’s already been done and dare to experiment. TED Circle challenges social innovators to rethink conventional approaches, push boundaries, and develop fresh, actionable solutions. We focus on what could be, rather than just what has been.
Network with bright and passionate minds
Impact grows when great minds come together. TED Circle brings together a community of change-makers, each with unique skills, perspectives, and ideas. Through deep conversations, meaningful collaborations, and shared experiences, participants gain insights, form alliances, and find inspiration to scale their work.
Start/Continue something new/amazing

TED Circle challenges you to introduce bold, transformative ideas where you are, whether by improving existing projects, launching innovative solutions, or influencing policy and organizational culture. The goal is to foster long-term, sustainable change from the inside out.
