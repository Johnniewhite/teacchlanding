TEAMS, ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
At TEACcH, we believe that innovation thrives in an environment where leadership
and accountability are shared. To this end, we operate a Holacracy system of
management:a decentralized system of leadership, ensuring that every team member
has a voice, a role, and an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our mission.
This approach empowers individuals and teams to take initiative, make decisions, and
drive progress without relying solely on a top-down leadership structure. By fostering
a collaborative culture, we create a dynamic workplace where creativity and
innovation flourish, and everyone feels a sense of ownership over the success of our
projects and programs.
Complementing this decentralized system is our Uplifter Model, which is rooted in
allyship, collaboration, and mutual growth. In this model:
Leaders act as allies and enablers, supporting team members in achieving their full
potential.
Accountability is reciprocal, with leaders and team members holding each other to
high standards of performance and integrity.
Collaboration is prioritized, creating an environment where team members uplift
one another through shared learning, encouragement, and resource sharing.
Feedback flows freely, fostering continuous improvement and building trust
within the team.
Together, these principles enable TEACcH to function as an agile, responsive, and
purpose-driven organization

grievance to their immediate Uplifter. If the issue involves the Uplifter or
remains unresolved, Team Members may escalate the matter to the HR
department.
Team Members can report their concerns verbally or in writing, depending on
the nature of the issue.
Step 3: Formal Complaint Process
For formal complaints, Team Members should submit a written grievance that
outlines:
A clear description of the issue.
Relevant dates and incidents.
Any efforts made to resolve the issue.
Desired outcome or resolution.
The HR department will acknowledge the receipt of the complaint within [time
frame], and a thorough investigation will be conducted. Team Members will be
kept informed of the progress.
Step 4: Investigation and Resolution
Once a formal complaint is received, HR will begin an investigation to
determine the facts and ensure fairness. All parties involved will be
interviewed, and any relevant evidence will be reviewed.
After the investigation is complete, HR will provide feedback to the Team
Members' regarding the outcome and any corrective actions taken (if
applicable).
Step 5: Follow-Up and Support
If the grievance has been resolved, HR will follow up with the Team Members'
to ensure the issue has been addressed to their satisfaction. If the issue
persists, additional steps may be taken to find an appropriate resolution.

TEACCH POLICY HANDBOOK
Open Door Policy
At TEACcH, we believe in fostering a culture of openness, trust, and communication.
Our Open Door Policy is designed to ensure that Team Members feel comfortable
speaking up about any concerns, suggestions, or issues they may have, regardless of
their role or position within the company.
Purpose: The goal of the Open Door Policy is to promote direct, honest
communication between Team Members and management, allowing issues to be
addressed quickly and transparently. Team Members are encouraged to approach
their managers or any member of the leadership team at any time with questions,
feedback, or concerns.
How It Works:
Team Members are encouraged to approach any member of the management
team, without the need for formal procedures, to discuss any concerns they
may have. This can be done in person or via email.
Management is expected to listen actively, provide guidance, and ensure that
issues are escalated if necessary.
Confidentiality and Respect:
All conversations under the Open Door Policy will be treated with
confidentiality and respect. The company values the privacy of its Team
Members, and no retaliation will be tolerated for raising legitimate concerns or
providing feedback.
Encouragement of Feedback:
We also encourage Team Members to offer constructive feedback on company
practices, processes, and culture. This feedback helps us identify areas of
improvement and create a better working environment for all.
Anonymous Reporting
For Team Members who may not feel comfortable reporting a grievance directly,
TEACcH provides the option for anonymous reporting through our designated
platform (admin@teacch.co)
Team Members can submit their concerns, grievances, or feedback without
revealing their identity. These reports will be treated with the same seriousness as
any other complaint, and appropriate follow-up actions will be taken.
Protection Against Retaliation
TEACcH maintains a strict policy against retaliation for any Team Member who uses
the grievance procedure, provides feedback, or reports misconduct in good faith.
Team Members who feel they have experienced retaliation should immediately report
the issue through the grievance mechanism, and it will be investigated accordingly.

Notification of Absence During Work Hours
At TEACcH, we prioritize effective communication and accountability within our team.

Team Members are required to notify their Uplifter (direct supervisor or manager)
in advance if they will be unavailable for any period during work hours. This

other reason that will result in the Team Members' being away from work.
Notify the Operations Team:
In addition to informing the Uplifter, Team Members must also alert the
Operations Team about their absence. This ensures that all relevant parties are
aware of the Team Members''s unavailability and can adjust plans or support as
needed.
Timely Communication:
For planned absences, Team Members must communicate at least 24 hours in
advance whenever possible.
For unplanned absences or emergencies, Team Members should inform their
Uplifter and the Operations Team as soon as possible. Immediate
communication will help to ensure a smooth workflow and minimal disruption
to team activities.
Alternative Arrangements:
If the Team Members' is stepping out for an extended period, they should discuss
with their Uplifter and the Operations Team any necessary arrangements, such as
task delegation, work rescheduling, or coverage for key responsibilities.
Extended Absences:
For absences lasting more than a day (such as for medical or personal reasons), Team
Members should keep both their Uplifter and the Operations Team informed about
their status and provide any relevant documentation as required.
